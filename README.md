# Resposnsive-Resume-Maker
I suggest you to edit HTML code (indexResume.html) to add your ABOUT, EDUCATION, SKILLS, PROFILE, CERTIFICATIONS etc.
You can change heading (h2) if you want to chnage but I suggest don't change it but change its inputs which are given by me.
You can also add some headings and desirable inputs, you want to show in your RESUME.

If you want then you can edit CSS code (styles.css) to add or remove or change the colours or any styles which are used to design this RESUME.
some examples of style: font style, list style, font size, font weight, border, margin, padding etc.
some examples of color: background colour, foreground color, border color, text color, font color etc.

I hope you will make an awesome responsive RESUME.
