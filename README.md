If you don't want to share your picture in the resume then remove <img src="pic.jpg" from HTML code otherwise 
First you have to change pic.jpg with your own picture. Make sure your picture's name is pic.jpg otherwise you have to change "pic.jpg" in the HTML code with your picture file name. 
I suggest you to edit HTML code (indexResume.html) to add your ABOUT, EDUCATION, SKILLS, PROFILE, CERTIFICATIONS etc.
You can change heading (h2) if you want to chnage but I recommend you don't change it but change its inputs which are given by me.
You can also add some headings and desirable inputs, you want to show in your RESUME.

If you want then you can edit CSS code (styles.css) to add or remove or change the colours or any styles which are used to design this RESUME.
some examples of style: font style, list style, font size, font weight, border, margin, padding etc.
some examples of color: background colour, foreground color, border color, text color, font color etc.

I hope you will design an awesome responsive RESUME.

If you want to save made resume as a pdf file then I want to say it's very hard to do that without any backend programm (as like php), 
if you want to do then should have a good understanding of php or any backend language.

BUT I want to say that you can save it as a pdf file but it'll not perfect as like original (which is made by using of php) it'll be readable and usable. You can upload it anywhere you want to uplpad (to apply for internship or job ).

Step 1: Choose option Print or use Ctrl + P.
Step 2: Set destination "save as PDF (This option can vary with your system but you have to choose that option in which "pdf" option is included)".
Step 3: Go to the option "more settings".
Step 4: Set margin: minimum.
Step 5: Set paper size A1 or that option in which resume fit in a single page.
(It's not necessary but it is a best option.)
Step 6: Tick (enable) option Background Graphics.
Step 7: Save.
